# REghZyAccountManagerV6
A password manager

A simple password manager written in C# using WPF (MVVM)

This doesn't use encrypted account files... yet. And currently the destination path is hard coded, 
so you'll need build the app yourself and change the path (located in MainView.xaml.cs at the top)

## Preview

I screenshotted this from the XAML designer, which is why it may look a bit pixellated, and is also why all the accounts are the same
